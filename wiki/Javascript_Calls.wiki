#Information about js calls into audio/voice applets


= Scope =
 
 * The whole idea of add js calls to applet born with a common need: How to compute the use of each applet? How to know if a specific user listened a .ogg file or tried the recognition applet?
 * To implement the solution of the following 2 js calls, the idea was: Send unique data from each applet. So for recognition applet was created a exeID variable, while for player applet we choose to send as a unique data the url of .ogg file that was played.


== ComputeExe ==

 * This call aims to send exercise ID from Voice Recognition applet.
 * This call just applies to Voice Recognition applet.

== ComputeUrl ==

 * This call aims to send the url of .ogg file from Audio Player applet.
 * This call just applies to Audio Player applet
